# Booking Restriction Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the booking restriction feature that prevents users from booking cars without providing their driver license and address details.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model Enhancement (`app/models/user.py`)
Added two new methods to the User model:

- **`has_complete_driver_details()`**: Checks if the user has complete driver license and address information
  - Validates license number and expiry date are present
  - Checks if license is not expired
  - Validates complete address (street, city, state, zip code)
  - Returns `True` only if all requirements are met

- **`get_missing_details()`**: Returns a list of missing profile details
  - Provides user-friendly messages for each missing field
  - Includes special handling for expired licenses
  - Used to guide users on what needs to be completed

### 2. Booking Route Protection (`app/routes/bookings.py`)
Modified the `create()` function to enforce profile completion:

- Added validation check at the beginning of the booking creation process
- If user profile is incomplete:
  - Generates a list of missing details
  - Shows a warning flash message listing what's missing
  - Redirects to the profile edit page
- Only allows booking creation if profile is complete

### 3. Cars Route Updates (`app/routes/cars.py`)
Enhanced both `index()` and `view()` functions:

- Added profile completion status check for authenticated users
- Passes `has_complete_profile` and `missing_details` to templates
- Enables conditional rendering of booking buttons

### 4. Template Updates

#### Cars Index Page (`templates/pages/cars/index.html`)
- Added a dismissible warning alert at the top for users with incomplete profiles
- Lists all missing profile details
- Includes a "Complete Profile" button linking to the edit profile page
- Modified "Book Now" button behavior:
  - Shows "Complete Profile to Book" button if profile is incomplete
  - Shows regular "Book Now" button only when profile is complete

#### Car View Page (`templates/pages/cars/view.html`)
- Added detailed warning message for users with incomplete profiles
- Lists specific missing details
- Provides "Complete Profile" button instead of "Book Now"
- Added "Login to Book" option for non-authenticated users

## User Experience Flow

### For Users with Incomplete Profiles:

1. **Cars Listing Page**: 
   - See a prominent warning about profile completion
   - "Book Now" buttons are replaced with "Complete Profile to Book"
   
2. **Individual Car Page**:
   - Detailed warning message with list of missing items
   - Large "Complete Profile" button instead of "Book Now"
   
3. **Direct Booking Attempt** (via URL):
   - Automatically redirected to profile edit page
   - Flash message explains what needs to be completed

### For Users with Complete Profiles:
- Normal booking flow is maintained
- All "Book Now" buttons work as expected
- Direct access to booking creation page

## Required Profile Fields

The following fields must be completed before booking:

1. **Driver License Information**:
   - License number
   - License expiry date (must not be expired)

2. **Address Information**:
   - Street address
   - City
   - State
   - ZIP code

## Benefits

1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensures all renters have valid driver licenses
2. **Risk Management**: Complete address information for all customers
3. **User Guidance**: Clear messaging about what's needed
4. **Flexible Implementation**: Easy to modify required fields in the future
5. **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't affect users who have already completed their profiles

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Server-side validation (cannot be bypassed by URL manipulation)
- Clear user feedback at multiple touchpoints
- Graceful handling of expired licenses
- Proper authentication checks

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Email reminders for profile completion
- Dashboard widget showing profile completion status
- Admin ability to override restrictions for specific users
- Additional validation (e.g., age verification, license type)
