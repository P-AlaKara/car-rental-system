# Vehicle Status Auto-Update & Photo Documentation Features

## Overview
Enhanced the vehicle return process with automatic status updates and photo documentation capabilities for better vehicle condition tracking.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Status Transition to "In Progress"
The system now automatically updates booking status from "Confirmed" to "In Progress" when the pickup date/time has passed.

#### How It Works:
- **Automatic Check**: Every time the bookings page is loaded, the system checks all confirmed bookings
- **Date Comparison**: If current date/time >= pickup date/time, status changes to "In Progress"
- **Car Status Update**: The car status is also updated to "BOOKED" automatically
- **No Manual Intervention**: Managers no longer need to manually start rentals if they forget

#### Implementation:
- Added `should_be_in_progress` property to Booking model
- Added `auto_update_status()` method for automatic transitions
- Status checks occur on:
  - Bookings index page load
  - Individual booking view page load
  - Any booking-related operation

#### Features:
- **Upload Photos at Any Stage**: Managers can upload photos during pickup or return
- **Photo Categorization**: Photos are tagged as "pickup" or "return" type
- **Angle Documentation**: Each photo can be labeled (front, back, left, right, interior, odometer, damage)
- **Caption Support**: Optional captions for each photo
- **Comparison View**: During return, managers can view pickup photos to compare condition

#### Database Structure:
New `vehicle_photos` table with:
- Booking association
- Photo URL storage
- Photo type (pickup/return)
